I WILL NEED TO PARAPHRASE THE FOLLOWING!!!!

!! IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I DO NOT COPY WORD FOR WORD TO AVOID PLAGIARISM!!!

!! THIS IS ONLY TO RECORD IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED DURING MY WRITE-UP
! THE FOLLOWING ARE PARAGRAPHS FROM R-IN-ACTION BY ROBERT I. KABACOFF

Regression analysis lives at the heart of statistics. A broad term for a set of methodologies used to predict a response variable from one or more 
predictor variables. Regression analysis can be used to identify the explanatory variables that are related to a response variable, to describe
 the form of the relatinoships involved, and to provide an equation for predicting the response variable from the explanatory variables. 
 
To properly interpret the coeffs, I must satisfy the following assumptions:

1. Normality
The Normal Q-Q Plot - probability plot of the standardized residuals against the values that would be expected under normality. 
The points on this graph should fall on the straight 45 degree line.

2. Independence
You can't tell if the dependent variable values are independent from these plots. Need to use the understanding of how the data was collected.


3. Linearity
If the dependent variable is linearly related to the independent variable, there should be NO systematic relationship between the residuals
and the predicted (fitted). The model should capture all the SYSTEMATIC VARIANCE PRESENT IN THE DATA, LEAVING NOTHING BUT RANDOM NOISE. 
In the Residuals vs fitted you could see clear evidence of a curved relationship which suggests that you may want to add a quadratic term to
the regression.

4. Homoscedasticity -- Constant variance

first-fit <- lm(y ~ A+B+C)  A,B,C are continuous variables

second-fit <- lm(y ~ A*B*C) ''

third_fit <- transform (first-fit)  transform == log  ## this didn't work at all

Nominal are variables that are categorical without implied order
Ordinal are variables that are categorical that have order but no sense of amount or magnitude

Variables:

Rank				N/A
Assumption: Rank is an imposed order completely derived from Total.Gross which is the response variable
and thus dependent on the other variables. Therefore, it should not be used in the model.

Movie.Title			Nominal, I think it's unimportant (That's not true)
Studio				Nominal
Total.Gross			Response (Y)
Theaters.Total		Continuous
Opening.Gross		Continuous
Theaters.Opening	Continuous
Open				Close - Open == Continuous
Close
Assumption: Years do not affect the Total.Gross response of a movie. The idea is that a movie's Total.Gross will not 
change if it was released in 2010 vs. 2011.

Regression models are good for predicting a quantitative response from quantitative predictor variables. But there's no reason that  we
I can't use nominal or ordinal factors as predictors as well.

Effects are primarily evaluated through F tests. If the F test is significant then I can conclude the mean for two different variables
differed. 

I skipped over all NA but did not change it's value so that I don't skew the results
